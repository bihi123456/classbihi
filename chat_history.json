You want me to plan the initial structure and features for a React Native + Expo app designed for student-professor interaction, including authentication, role-based interfaces, and specific functionalities for each role. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Authentication:** Implement login/registration flows for both students and professors, with input fields as specified in your description.\n*   **Role-Based Home Screens:** Design separate home screens for students and professors, displaying relevant information and navigation options.\n*   **Navigation:** Implement a side menu (like Facebook) for both student and professor interfaces, providing access to different sections.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#3F51B5` (Indigo, a professional and calming color)\n    *   Secondary: `#E91E63` (Pink, for highlights and calls to action)\n    *   Accent: `#03A9F4` (Light Blue, for interactive elements)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White, for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFD54F` (Yellow, for important notifications or selections)\n*   **Typography:** Use \"Roboto\" for a modern and readable font.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** The project is already set up.\n2.  **Authentication Screens:** Create the Login and Registration screens for both students and professors.\n    *   Implement input fields as specified in the user's request.\n    *   Implement section selection using a dropdown list for students.\n    *   Implement subject selection using a dropdown list for professors.\n    *   Implement photo upload functionality.\n    *   Implement email verification upon registration.\n3.  **Role-Based Home Screens:** Create separate home screens for students and professors.\n    *   Student Home Screen: Display options for viewing profiles, messages, exams, attendance, and absences.\n    *   Professor Home Screen: Display a section selection dropdown and options for publishing exams, viewing responses, managing messages, and managing absences.\n4.  **Navigation:** Implement a side menu for both student and professor interfaces.\n    *   Use the `FloatingTabBar.tsx` component as a reference for creating the side menu.\n5.  **Data Storage:** The user needs to enable Supabase to store the data.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan. After the implementation, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-06T18:15:51.402975"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build this comprehensive student-professor interaction app. Let me start by searching for relevant information and then implement the basic structure."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the current project structure to understand what we're working with:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I'll implement the student-professor app according to the requirements.
